### What and why?
How much time do you spend switching windows and tabs? ViewPoint is a holistic approach to screen-space management with the aim of increasing productivity and decreasing wasted time. There are many tab organizers and widgets out there, but not many are able to allow the user to fully customize their screen. ViewPoint was created out of the frustrations of using windows splitscreen, google group tabs and many more poor solutions to a simple problem: I can't see what I need to on my device. 

### For whom?
ViewPoint is for anyone tired of switching windows and tabs. Its ideal end-user is someone with a large enough device to reap its benefits. A mobile user will be significantly more limited in their customization ability, whereas laptop and desktop users will see much more customization functionality. 

### How?
From an end-users perspective, ViewPoint will manage all your active windows and tabs in a single window. It will act as a principal container space where a user can view multiple application windows and tabs in a single ViewPoint window, so that switching windows and tabs is rendered obselete. 

### Scope
The project skeleton could be created by leveraging the CSS grid system to create basic screen partitions. However, as the semester advances implementing the features listed below would be sufficiently challenging to require the collective efforts of 5 programmers. 

#### Features
- Drag and drop: drag and drop windows and tabs into your ViewPoint window to see them
- Add/Remove container: add/remove containers into your ViewPoint window space
- Resize container: Resize any application, window or tab container in your ViewPoint window
- Reorder container: Reorder your ViewPoint containers for complete control of your screen
- Multi-monitor mode: Support for users with multiple monitors
